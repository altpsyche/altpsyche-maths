# Roadmap

**This file is the only queue.** If a piece of work is not written below, nobody is tracking it.
[DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md) is the design and queues nothing.

## The goal, stated by Siva

**Anyone who installs this package should be able to make mathematical animations of the quality
3Blue1Brown publishes.** Manim is the reference, and the two ideas already taken from it are that a
picture is a timeline of animations over named objects and that those objects are measured in the
picture's own units. The goal now is the rest of the vocabulary.

**What that does not mean.** Manim is roughly a decade of work and tens of thousands of lines. The
quality of those videos is also substantially the writing and the pacing, which no library supplies.
What is queued here is the part a library can be held to: whether a picture that channel would draw
can be expressed at all.

**What decides the order.** A package is real when it has a consumer that ships, which is the
argument [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md) makes about timing moving in here before a single figure existed. So
an item earns its place by a picture something is waiting to draw, and the two demos below are what
is waiting until the website has a chapter that is.

**The website waits.** Its own roadmap has one open item and nothing there needs anything from this
page, so this package is worked to 1.0.0 first and the site is picked up after.

## The two decisions are answered

Both were Siva's and both are made. They are recorded here because they shape every item below, and
DESIGN.md is corrected to match.

**The typesetter goes behind the one door.** MathJax becomes a runtime dependency of this package
rather than sitting behind a second entry point. The reason is that nobody installs a figures package
without needing to label a picture with mathematics, so a consumer paying for MathJax and never
typesetting is a consumer who does not exist. It runs at build time, so what a reader downloads does
not change. **What would change this answer** is a consumer who draws figures and typesets nothing,
which would make a second door worth its test.

**A figure stops being flat.** Surfaces and vectors in space are a large share of the pictures this
package is meant to be able to draw, so refusing them refuses the goal. The camera is a figure's own
and never the engine's, which is the rule DESIGN.md keeps. **Which version it lands in was left to
the session and the answer is 0.9.0**, last of the feature versions, because everything before it is
reusable in three dimensions and nothing in three dimensions is reusable in two. **What would change
that** is a chapter needing a surface sooner.

## The version ladder

**Every item gets its own minor version, then 1.0.0 is the polish.** Siva's plan, and the release
convention this repository already follows makes each one a minor bump. A version is cut when its
demos draw, not when its code compiles. A version that is cut leaves this table and its item goes
with it, because `git log` is what keeps a closed plan.

| version | what lands |
| --- | --- |
| 0.8.0 | Braces, a number that counts, boolean operations on paths |
| 0.9.0 | Three dimensions, and a camera that moves |
| 0.10.0 | Vector fields and streamlines |
| 0.11.0 | Frames out, with no website around it |
| 1.0.0 | The two demos complete, the README, the surface frozen |

**The order is not arbitrary and one place in it is worth defending.** Three dimensions sit at 0.9.0
for the reason above. A camera that moves rides with 0.9.0 because a figure's camera is one piece of
work whether it is orbiting a surface or panning across a plane, and splitting it would build the
same matrix twice.

## The two demos, which are what a version is cut against

**One demo in two dimensions and one in three, and every feature reaches both.** Siva's ask, and it
is also the test DESIGN.md sets for whether a feature is real: a package is real when it has a
consumer that ships, and until the website has a chapter waiting on axes these two are that consumer.

They are written before the feature they need, as the target the work is built to compile. That is
the order rather than a preference: a demo written afterwards checks that the code runs, where a demo
written first says what the code has to be able to say.

**The flat demo is a tangent sliding along a curve**, and it draws as of 0.4.0. It is
`demos/tangent.ts`: the grid, both axes with ticks and labels, the plotted parabola, the region
shaded under it, a point walking along it, the tangent at that point, and the slope written as a
number that changes. As of 0.5.0 the picture arrives rather than appearing, and the walk is measured
along the curve's own length so the dot keeps one speed. As of 0.6.0 the number sits under the
typeset rule it is a value of, and as of 0.7.0 that rule reads `\frac{dy}{dx} = 0` at the stationary
point and walks into `\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x` as the dot leaves it.

**How the walk is driven was Siva's call and the answer is the track.** The track drives a fraction of
the curve's length and the scene recovers the graph x from the point it lands on, so the dot, the
tangent and the reading are one number. Driving the dot with a `moveAlong` span while the tangent
stayed on an x track would have been two clocks free to disagree, since a span's eased fraction and a
track's value are unrelated. **What would change this answer** is an animation that can hand the
scene back what it did, which the seam refuses on purpose.

Every version after adds to that same figure: a brace measures the rise at 0.8.0, the view follows
the point at 0.9.0, and the curve's gradient becomes a field at 0.10.0.

**The solid demo starts at 0.9.0**, because nothing before it can draw one, and it is a surface with
a plane cutting through it and the curve of the intersection drawn on both. What it then takes from
the versions before it is everything reusable in three dimensions: the axes become three, the
animations apply to marks in space, the equation of the surface is typeset beside it, and the camera
orbits.

**A version is not cut until its demos draw.** The measurement is the demo's own marks: a count at
named times, compared by tolerance, which is the gate DESIGN.md describes and which needs no browser.

**Both demos are committed and both are in the README**, which the flat one is as of 0.4.0. The
image is SVG written by `svgMarkup`, which needs no browser, so `npm run demos` regenerates it and a
gate compares the regenerated bytes against the committed file. A picture in a README that nothing
regenerates goes stale in silence. **A moving image in a README needs a GIF and this package has no
encoder**, so what the README carries beside the still is a strip of frames in one SVG, which shows
the motion in a still.

## Now

**0.7.0 is cut and 0.8.0 is next, and it needs its steps written before it is worked.** Writing them
is a session on its own. The colour reader queued below the items is wanted by nothing above it yet,
and the item after it is the first thing that planning session has to weigh against a brace.

## The items

Each is a version above. What follows is what each one covers.

### Braces, a number that counts, boolean operations on paths, 0.8.0

`Brace`, a brace with a label on it, and a number that ticks from one value to another, all three
heavily used by the reference material against the `arrow`, `callout` and `dot` that exist. Union,
intersection and difference on paths, which Manim has and this has no way to express.

### Three dimensions and a camera that moves, 0.9.0

A figure's own camera with a projection, a depth sort, marks placed in space, and surfaces. `vec3`
and `Vec3` already exist and nothing above them uses either. `Extent` is fixed for the life of a
figure today, so nothing can zoom, pan or orbit, and an extent that is a function of time or a keyed
track is the same piece of work as the camera rather than a separate one.

**A rotation still has no picture in either demo.** Nothing in a flat graph turns, so `rotate` is
held by its own tests until a surface arrives here for it to orbit. That is the one place Siva's ask
that every feature reach both demos is outstanding.

**This is larger than everything else on this page put together**, and it is the one item where the
boundary DESIGN.md draws against the engine has to be restated rather than assumed.

### Vector fields and streamlines, 0.10.0

A field sampled over a region, and a streamline integrated through one.

### Frames out, 0.11.0

A consumer gets marks and a canvas painter and no way to turn either into a file. The encode step is
in the website rather than here. What is missing is a headless call that walks a figure at a fixed
step and hands back frames.

### The polish, 1.0.0

Both demos complete, the README carrying both, and the public surface frozen. A 1.0.0 is a promise
about `index.ts` not changing under a consumer, so what it needs beyond the features is a read of the
whole door with that promise in mind.

## Found while working, not yet queued

- **Two colours cannot be walked between.** A colour is any CSS colour written as text, and there is
  no parser here, so `indicate` swaps a colour rather than easing into one and nothing can cross-fade
  a palette. What it needs is a reader for the forms a figure is actually handed, which is hex and
  `rgb()`, and a refusal for the rest rather than a wrong answer. Found while planning 0.5.0. The
  typesetter's own red is spotted by comparing the string and needs none of this.

- **The picture gate is engine-dependent at a rounding boundary.** A coordinate is written to three
  decimal places, so the sine and cosine differences between engines are invisible in the bytes,
  which is what lets the committed pictures be compared byte for byte at all. A value landing exactly
  on a half in the fourth place would still round two ways. Nothing has hit it, and the fix if
  anything ever does is a picture gate that compares marks by tolerance rather than bytes, which
  costs the gate its ability to say the committed file is stale. Found while planning step 8 of
  0.5.0.

## Someday

- **Gradients along a stroke or across a fill.** DESIGN.md refuses them under the rule that a mark
  may only ask for what both painters can do, and both painters can do gradients, so the refusal is
  worth re-reading rather than assumed.
- **A variable-width stroke.** What Manim gets from its own renderer and neither painter here offers.
